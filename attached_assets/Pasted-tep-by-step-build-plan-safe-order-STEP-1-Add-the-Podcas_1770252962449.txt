tep-by-step build plan (safe order)
STEP 1 — Add the Podcasts tab + screens (UI only)
Screens

PodcastsScreen (main feed)

PodcastShowDetailScreen

PodcastEpisodeDetailScreen (optional; can be a modal)

What PodcastsScreen shows (simple MVP)

Sections:

Buzzing Now (Podcasts) – top buzz episodes/shows

New Drops (24–72h) – recent episodes

Top in US / Top in UK – can be based on your buzz until you add charts

✅ No search yet. No player yet.

STEP 2 — Add backend “podcast module” endpoints (mock first)

Add these endpoints to your existing API:

GET /api/podcasts/buzz?region=US

GET /api/podcasts/new?region=US

GET /api/podcasts/show/:id

GET /api/podcasts/episode/:id

POST /api/podcasts/events

GET /api/podcasts/follows?guestId=...

POST /api/podcasts/follows/add

POST /api/podcasts/follows/remove

Start with mock JSON responses so the app UI works immediately.

STEP 3 — Add DB tables for podcasts

Add migrations:

podcast_shows

id (Podcast Index show id)

title

description

image

language

country

author

feed_url

updated_at

podcast_episodes

id (Podcast Index episode id)

show_id

title

description

image

date_published (unix or timestamp)

audio_url (optional)

duration

updated_at

podcast_follows

guest_id

show_id

region

added_at
(unique on guest_id + show_id)

podcast_events

guest_id

region (US/GB)

event_type (episode_view, show_follow, episode_save)

show_id (nullable)

episode_id (nullable)

created_at

podcast_buzz_cache

region

entity_type (show or episode)

entity_id

score

window_start

window_end

computed_at

STEP 4 — Wire Podcast Index API (real data)

Podcast Index has a free API with authentication headers (API key + secret).

You’ll add env vars:

PODCAST_INDEX_KEY

PODCAST_INDEX_SECRET

Then implement these backend fetchers:

fetchRecentEpisodes(region) (new drops)

fetchShow(showId)

fetchEpisode(episodeId)

MVP approach for “New Drops”:

pull recent episodes broadly (English) and filter by region preference (US/GB) lightly (or by language=en)

cache them

STEP 5 — Buzz ranking for podcasts (same as BuzzReel)

In your existing refresh job (or a new one):

compute buzz from podcast_events last 24h

apply weights:

episode_view = 1

episode_save = 3

show_follow = 4

decay:

last 6h = 1.0x

6–24h = 0.5x

Then PodcastsScreen “Buzzing Now” uses podcast_buzz_cache.

STEP 6 — Monetization hook (later)

Free:

Browse podcasts

Follow up to 10 shows

Pro:

Unlimited follows

Drop alerts (new episode for followed show)

No ads

No login required.
